## GA Project 3
#### Team of 2
This was the third project during my time on the Web Development Immersive course (12 weeks of full-time) at General Assembly. The project took place in the week 9. [>>To the Site<<](https://xhibit.herokuapp.com/#!/)

**Note**
- The app is not yet fully responsive. For best experience open on the laptop.
- The site may load slower than the average(2-3 seconds) loading time.

#### Course Curriculum :

> **Week 7-8** | Module Three

- Angular
- Token Authentication & Session Authentication
- Third-party APIs
- Mocha and Chai

*Full curriculum available at the bottom of the page.*

## Brief
The course instructors had partnered students with other classmates to design and collaboratively build a MEAN (MongoDB, Express, Angular, Node.js) stack app of their own design.

> **Server side**
* Use Mongo, Node & Express to build a server-side API
* API must have at least 2 related models, one of which should be a user
* API should include all RESTFUL actions for at least one of those models.
* Include authentication to restrict access to appropriate users
* Include at least one referenced or embedded sub-document
* Include automated tests

> **Client side**
* Use Angular
* Use SCSS
* Use Webpack & Yarn** to manage your dependencies and compile your source code

**Timeframe :** 1 week (November 2018)

## Concept
Search new art exhibitions in the capital, read reviews, bookmark exhibitions and make a comment about what you think. The group found a common interest in art and both member had a same goals.

## Goal
Enhanced manpower, 7 days to plan and build. My list of priorities:
- Fulfill the brief. There were more requirements then the previous projects.
- Time management. MVP focused project management. More men could also mean more variables.
  The team both agreed it is important to track time and keep an eye on.
- Team work. The team decided to use Trello Technology to assign tasks and track the progress.
- Stress control.

**Stress control**
> - High fives on wins.
